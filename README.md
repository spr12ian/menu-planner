The code shown in this GitHub repository (repo) is the Google Apps Script code behind a Google Sheets spreadsheet.

I created a Google Scripts project called 'example-project' in the cloud

In a local projects folder:
```bash
mkdir example-project
cd example-project
npm install @google/clasp@2.4.0
```

These files were added to .claspignore to prevent them being uploaded to Google Scripts:
+ .git
+ README.md

I can't get this to work at present so ignore this repo until further notice (possibly never).
